            <p>The topic of <span class="no-poster">this conference</span> <span class="poster-only">the <span class="poster-less-letter-spacing"><b>2017 International Symposium of the Faculty of Architecture and the Built Environment — TU Delft, with visiting professors ROTOR,</b> </span></span> is off-site reuse <span class="poster-only"><br></span>in architecture, a practice that involves salvaging components and materials from buildings that have reached the end of their life cycle, in order to reuse <span class="poster-only"><br></span>them elsewhere. Off-site reuse has been a common practice for centuries; however, during the twentieth century it became a forgotten art as most buildings <span class="poster-only"><br></span><span class="poster-less-letter-spacing">were built with no idea about reuse and the concomitant</span> question of sustainability. Today, the idea of off-site <span class="poster-only"><br></span>reuse is once again gaining momentum as the linear modes of materials consumption proper to the <span class="poster-only"><br></span>age of industrialization are being questioned.</p>
            <p>Yet, in a highly streamlined building industry, many <span class="poster-less-letter-spacing">obstacles and tenacious routines need to be overcome</span> <span class="poster-only"><br></span>to make these practices more than marginal again. <span class="poster-less-letter-spacing">Legislations need to be rewritten, certification protocols</span> <span class="poster-only"><br></span>to be reinvented; designers need to change habits, engineers to rethink component assembly technologies, etc. In the past decades, deconstruction professionals, designers and other experts have pushed this agenda <span class="poster-only"><br></span>and made some valuable progress. This symposium will bring several of these actors together in order to gauge where we stand now, what lies ahead and what <span class="poster-only"><br></span>progress is within reach, in terms of engineering, <span class="poster-only"><br></span>design and overall policy.</p>
            <p>The breached topics will fall under the following headings: </p>
            <p class="theme-questions">— What might off-site reuse mean in terms <span class="poster-only"><br></span>of building culture, heritage and social value?<br>
            — How to deconstruct existing buildings <span class="poster-only"><br></span>slated for demolition practically? What are <span class="poster-only"><br></span>the technological, logistical and adminis<span class="poster-only">-<br></span>trative implications?<br>
            — What design challenges, but also opportunities lie in the integration of existing components in new structures?<br>
            — How to design buildings in such a way <span class="poster-only"><br></span>that you maximize its potential for later reuse, on site, but also off-site? Is the “legolization” <span class="poster-only"><br></span>of the building industry within reach? And <span class="poster-only"><br></span>is it desirable?</p>

            <h2>CONTEXT</h2>
            <p>The conference Deconstruction and this publication are part of the Visiting Professorship of Rotor — Lionel Devlieger and Maarten Gielen—at the Faculty of Architecture and the Built Environment, TU Delft, in collaboration with the Jaap Bakema Study Centre (JBSC) and Het Nieuwe Instituut, in Spring 2017.</p>
            <p>Representing a new approach to contemporary architectural practice, Rotor develops critical positions on design, material resources and waste through research, exhibitions, writings and conferences. Core element of their professorship is a special studio, focused on the deconstruction of modernist and contemporary buildings slated for demolition, to make their components available for a redesign assignment.</p>
            <p>With the Visiting Professors programme The Faculty of Architecture and The Built Environment attracts nationally and internationally renowned designers to contribute to the renewal of research and education with their outlooks and networks.</p>

During his education and as extraordinary researcher at TU Delft and TU Eindhoven he has been dedicated to the survey of early 20th century architecture and the preservation and adaptive re-use of such buildings. He is the co-founder of DOCOMOMO International, a worldwide network of architectural historians, architects and preservation specialists in this field.<br>
            As a practicing architect he realised a.o. the restoration of Gerrit Rietveld´s Biennale Pavilion in Venice of 1953-1954, and various schemes for social housing and educational buildings. Wessel de Jonge Architecten has a particular expertise in the field of adaptive re-use of buildings, often in a dynamic urban context, and combined with newly designed structures. The studio has been in charge of the restoration and adaptive re-use of the former Sanatorium Zonnestraal of 1928-31 (with Bierman Henket Architects), the master planning and coordination of the conversion of the Van Nelle Factory in Rotterdam (1928-31) and the former Technical Schools in Groningen (1923), the restoration of the St.Jobs warehouse (1914), and the HUF building (1953) in Rotterdam, the conversion of the Social Security Building GAK (1959) into housing for young professionals and the renewal of the 1950s National Aerospace Laboratories NLR in Amsterdam. Last year, the restoration of a former 1956 vocational school in Amsterdam to accommodate the Cygnus Grammar School was awarded the national Golden Phoenix prize. The Van Nelle Factory has been inscribed on the World Heritage List of UNESCO in June 2014.

The main aim of 2012 is to build on with the existing potential of the site, such as existing environment, potential workforce, energy sources, and waste materials. Recyclicity tries to turn different waste streams into building materials with as little added energy as possible for transport and modification. Jongert worked on various projects ranging from the whitegoods-house (1999), the Miele Space station II (2003) up to a Wastestream Villa. Jan Jongert frequently lectures and teaches architects, students and general public both in the Netherlands and abroad. From 2005 on, he teaches on reuse of waste for buildings at the academy of architecture in Rotterdam and in various workshops like in Madrid and Buenos Aires. In 2007 he co-published a book and website called Superuse.</p>

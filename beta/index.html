Off-site reuse has been a common practice for centuries; however, during the twentieth century it became a forgotten art as most buildings <span class="poster-only"><br></span><span class="poster-less-letter-spacing">were built with no idea about reuse and the concomitant</span> question of sustainability. Today, the idea of off-site <span class="poster-only"><br></span>reuse is once again gaining momentum as the linear modes of materials consumption proper to the <span class="poster-only"><br></span>age of industrialization are being questioned.</p>
                <p>Yet, in a highly streamlined building industry, many <span class="poster-less-letter-spacing">obstacles and tenacious routines need to be overcome</span> <span class="poster-only"><br></span>to make these practices more than marginal again. <span class="poster-less-letter-spacing">Legislations need to be rewritten, certification protocols</span> <span class="poster-only"><br></span>to be reinvented; designers need to change habits, engineers to rethink component assembly technologies, etc. In the past decades, deconstruction professionals, designers and other experts have pushed this agenda <span class="poster-only"><br></span>and made some valuable progress.

                <p>The breached topics will fall under the following headings: </p>
                <p class="theme-questions">— What might off-site reuse mean in terms <span class="poster-only"><br></span>of building culture, heritage and social value?<br>
                — How to deconstruct existing buildings <span class="poster-only"><br></span>slated for demolition practically? What are <span class="poster-only"><br></span>the technological, logistical and adminis<span class="poster-only">-<br></span>trative implications?<br>
                — What design challenges, but also opportunities lie in the integration of existing components in new structures?<br>
                — How to design buildings in such a way <span class="poster-only"><br></span>that you maximize its potential for later reuse, on site, but also off-site?

            <p class="booklet-quote">‘Design for deconstruction’, or DfD, as it is often known — is a pragmatic, industry approach to the cradle to cradle idea. We would note that “deconstruction”, in this usage owes more to the construction industry than to continental philosophy. The United States’ National Institute of Building sciences refers to deconstruction in their Whole Building Design Guide as… the “systematic disassembly of a building generally in the reverse order, of construction, in an economical and safe fashion for the purposes of preserving materials for their reuse”. In the DfD approach, materials and assemblage systems are selected in readiness for the end of the buildings’ life, so that they are better able to be upcycled, rather than laid waste or poorly recycled. The aspiration of design for deconstruction is to code the logic of unmaking into the building from the very earliest point of its making.</p>

            <h3 style="margin-top: 0;">Studio Rotor: Deconstruction</h3>
            <p>For the spring semester 2016-2017 the Faculty of Architecture and the Built Environment welcomes as Visiting Professors Lionel Devlieger and Maarten Gielen of the Brussels based office Rotor. Being a relatively young office, their work is representative for a new kind of emerging practice in architecture, in which various disciplines are combined - from research and exhibition making to material studies and re-use strategies. Rotor made its fame with their installation ‘Usus / Usures’ at the Belgian Pavilion at the Venice Biennale of 2010. ‘Usus / Usures’ was entirely made up from salvaged building components, which are usually overlooked and treated as waste, such as carpet, stairs, railings <i>et cetera</i>. These elements were exhibited in an isolated manner as to draw closer attention to their own intrinsic qualities, despite, or perhaps exactly because of their anonymous and ordinary appearance, and because of the traces of wear and tear caused by everyday use.</p>
            <p>From thereon Rotor continued its critical investigation in sustainability issues in architecture in various projects and exhibitions, including the Oslo Triennale 2013 ‘Behind the Green Door’ and the 2016 exhibition ‘Constellations’ at the Architecture Centre Arc en Rêve in Bordeaux. This year, Rotor was awarded for its innovative work with the annual Blueprint Architecture Award and the Global Award for Sustainable Architecture, while Maarten Gielen received the Young Maaskant Prize 2015 of the city of Rotterdam.</p>
            <p>Core element of the Rotor Visiting Professorship is a special MSc studio that focuses on the deconstruction of modernist and contemporary buildings slated for demolition, as to make their components available for a radical redesign assignment. The studio will be an intense 10-weeks workshop programme combining archival research, building analysis, site visits and radical redesign.</p>
            <p>The studio will follow the iterative cycles of data collection and analysis, research and design. Three case studies will be investigated to challenge the limits of material re-use. Students will be challenged to rethink architectural design and history from the questions of re-use in the broadest sense imaginable: re-use of ideas, of composition and building techniques, re-use of knowledge, of archives and memory, re-use of materials and of building elements.</p>
            <p>Archive seminars at Het Nieuwe Instituut are part of the studio as to analyse the selected historical cases. These are from the historical production of Dutch Structuralism. Apart from collecting information, producing overviews of design development etc., the main question involves what elements of this historical production lend themselves for re-use?</p>

        <div id="print-page-5" class="print-page booklet-only">
            <p>Next to the dossiers of Dutch Structuralism other architects’ collections from the national archive of Het Nieuwe Instituut as well as iconic, contemporary projects will also be part of the research as to enable comparative analyses, in terms of performance, potential for recycling and reappropriation, including aesthetic possibilities. From this point of view, the archive is not to be considered an ‘art historical’ reservoir that houses the canon of Dutch architecture, but the archive is a resource providing basic building material, as well as an active element for the (re)design of projects.</p>
            <p>This question of re-using existing buildings, their history and the archive has also a literal dimension: how can the historical buildings be taken apart into elements (construction, materials) and re-assembled in new ways. Through a practice of material re-use buildings themselves are to be reconsidered as repositories, not just of materials but also of knowledge and past practices that might find new applications, becoming part of new value systems.</p>
            <p>The question is also intended as a provocation to trigger a debate on the value and role of history and the archive in contemporary architectural design. Not only does this approach entail the urgent questions of sustainability and re-use, but it also implies a need for a different view on history and the historical production as a resource for innovation. </p>

            <p>The start of the Rotor Visiting Professorship is marked by an international conference on deconstruction and re-use, as to present and debate the central issues of the studio. International experts will present new innovative design approached and inspiring best cases. Midway the studio, a public lecture by Rotor will take place, while at the end of the studio presentations will be combined with public reviews with special guests.</p>
            <p>The archival research (including two research seminars) will be co-organized with the Jaap Bakema Study Centre at Het Nieuwe Instituut in Rotterdam.</p>

            <h3 style="margin-top: 0;">Urban Mining, Salvaging Materials. Conference statement</h3>
            <p>The topic of this conference — off-site building components reuse — might seem narrow and, at first sight, thinly relevant to an architectural education programme. We are talking about how to disassemble one component from a building that is meant to disappear, and how to integrate it into a new realization. We will be discussing demolition and dismantling technologies, logistics, industrial design of components, second hand markets. We will be reflecting upon legal issues, questions of liability, certification, taxation, employment opportunities, etc. Yet we believe, and this conviction motivates both the symposium and the studio, that these seemingly peripheral but profoundly concrete questions, outline, in filigree, the central challenges for the development of a circular building industry. </p>

            <p>The urge to build greener, like environmentalism, appeared in the late 1960’s, early 1970’s, but was dominated for decades by the question of energy efficiency. A green building was a building that consumed less fossil fuels than its ‘unsustainable’ equivalent. The focus was later on how much CO2 a building emitted during its ‘operational life’. Only recently did one start to take that building’s entire lifecycle into account. Experts now calculate, for instance, how much energy was used to extract, transform, transport and assemble all components of a building before it starts operating. That quantity, the total embodied energy, is but one of the parameters assessed during a life cycle analysis (LCA), the increasingly popular but tediously complicated account of a building’s impact during its lifecycle; a cycle that runs from origination until demolition. Evaluating the impact of the disposal of the remains is equally part of such an assessment. These calculations have allowed a recent, direly needed reappraisal of eminently material problems such as the depletion of the natural resources and the troublesome accumulation of waste materials caused by the building industry, out of which almost nothing but low grade, down-cycled products can be derived. </p>

            <p>Therefore, bending our materials economy, in this case our building materials economy, from a linear arrow to a circular loop, has become the latest urgency. Public authorities in many European countries are now issuing regulations in favour of a circular economy. But the gap between intentions and day-to-day practice is wide. Planned obsolescence and the wasting of material resources still seems inscribed into the DNA of today’s businesses, also in the construction sector. To shift the current state of affairs, three different courses of action in favour of a circular building economy should be pushed forward: </p>
            <table>
                <tr>
                    <td>1.</td><td>The first one of these wants to change how buildings are made. It is the engineer’s approach. It is also referred to as Design for Deconstruction or Design for Change. It implies that if precious resources are wasted when a building reaches the end of its lifecyle, buildings should be conceived differently. They should be designed in such a way that they are easy to modify, as to preclude functional obsolescence, or easy to disassemble, without the loss of component functionality and value.</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>2.</td><td>The second course of action, urges primarily for different business models, which would unyoke a builder’s profitability from the necessity to sell goods, and thus to consume material resources. An example is architect Thomas Rau, who advocates the servitisation of built infrastructures: so-called end-users would no longer be paying for goods (buildings), they would pay for services (access to, heated, lit, and ventilated spaces). The provider of these services, who is also the owner of the building and its contained equipment, will necessarily manage his property carefully and make sure that its operational life would be a long as possible. Wastefulness will be minimized. </td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>3.</td><td>A third course of action — the one that to us at Rotor seems most within reach — is that of urban mining. Instead of trying to change how the current industry works, it focuses on the task of salvaging a maximum of material value from the built environment as it exists today. Urban mining, as any form of mining, can go from the most brute (the equivalent of the open pit mining with heavy machinery, i.e. recycling), to the most sophisticated - similar to the careful extraction of solid blocs of natural stone, whereby the original features and functional qualities of the component are preserved, i.e. reuse.</td>

            <p>In this symposium, meant to be pragmatic without shunning the contemplative, we will focus first and foremost on the third approach. <span class="booklet-only"><br></span>The entire second session is dedicated to concrete examples, from the US and the Netherlands, of practices which engage in value identification <span class="booklet-only"><br></span>and/or building components salvage. Studying these actors and their <span class="booklet-only"><br></span>day-to-day operations, will, to our view, also yield interesting lessons for <span class="booklet-only"><br></span>the DfD approach. </p>
            <p>Companies that are engaging in large scale salvage operations of reuseable building components are still rare, but their number will probably expand in the years to come. It is interesting to observe how this echoes a larger phenomenon, the emergence of the remanufacturing industry. Remanufacturing is defined as ‘the rebuilding of a product to specifications of the original manufactured product using a combination of reused, repaired and new parts’ (Wikipedia). It is growing big in the automotive and aeronautic sector, under the impulse of specific measures, such as a French law from 2015 that forces every car mechanic in France to offer the remanufactured, second hand components as a (cheaper) alternative to the purchase of new component. It offers in any case a model for a thriving economical sector that is not relying on the consumption of raw materials, while equally avoiding the risk of putting all means of production and all ownership in the hands of a few omnipotent players (as under option 2). </p>

            <p>Now it must also be observed that most of the products (engines, tires, copiers, cell-phones, …) that come into consideration for remanufacturing differ from buildings in that they had been serially produced originally. Even if buildings contain numerous components produced in industrial series (lighting fixtures, door hinges, nuts, bolts and steel profiles, they are almost all unique, tailor-made to a specific site and answering specific functional and aesthetic requirements. If every construction site is unique, that means that every deconstruction site will be unique as well. As long as buildings will not become serial products, their careful dismantling will require ad-hoc experts, capable of adapting their course of action to circumstances. This means the activity will remain investment-heavy in terms of labour force. At Rotor Deconstruction, we calculated that dismantling on average requires 7 times more personnel than evacuating the same amount of materials using the ‘classical’, destructive methods with motorized equipment. Considering the cost of workforce this imposes serious limitations on the economic feasibility of deconstruction activities. But the argument can be turned around, and seen as an opportunity to create manual jobs, especially in dense city centres, where the disappearance of industrial activity contributes to high unemployment rates.</p>

            <p>The disparity of the built environment brings us to another topic, which is the question of heritage. Looking at a building as an assemblage of elements that can be dismantled and reassembled again, possibly into totally new configurations forces us to reassess our understanding of architectural heritage. Until now, the focus in built heritage preservation has been largely on the conservation of the integrity of a design as it was devised by the architect, considered the main author of the assemblage. From that point of view, once the integrity of the building is lost, all is lost. Once you open up the possibility of looking at the heritage question on different scale levels, other forms of equally interesting authorship arise. It happens that we salvage marbles that are now extinct, whose quarries have been totally emptied, or that we reclaim industrial tiles produced with technologies no longer available in factories long closed. Building products such as these, carry not only their share of embodied energy or carbon that can be made useful again, but also embodied culture, that can charge a new project with a supplementary meaning. The first session of the symposium, will be largely dedicated to these issues, in the context of a larger assessment of the relationship between architectural reuse and history. </p>

            <p>We believe a thorough historical investigation into past forms of end-of-life-care for buildings is necessary to address where we stand today and where we come from. Documentary evidence tells us that all past eras in the history of architecture featured far-reaching examples of building component reuse that are to be considered best practices from the point of view of resource-efficiency. Specific instances also offer inspiring examples for how this component reuse was organized economically and legally. History, finally, also teaches us how the disappearance of these age-old practices came about, somewhere in the course of the 20th-century, under the combined influence of increased real-estate pressure, an obsession for speed in demolition, the availability of power-machines and explosives, and fiscal constructions that encouraged accelerated building obsolescence. </p>
            <p>The last session of this symposium will feature a wide range of recent realizations that include either reclaimed components, or that are designed with future reclamation in mind. These presentations will offer the opportunity to gauge the pertinence and reproducibility of these  approaches with the considerations about economics and salvage logistics in mind. But it will also show how designers compose functional assemblage while exploiting the embodied culture that these components carry along. </p>

            <p>The architecture studio for which this symposium is the launching pad is equally entitled Deconstruction. It will combine the meticulous analysis of a series of study cases - one newly erected building that anticipated future disassembly, one that has been taken down and might be reassembled soon, and another one that is slated for - at least partial - demolition, with a series of specific design challenges with reclaimed components. The idea is to expose the students to all aspects of building component reclamation and reuse. From archival study over transport logistics to integration into a newly built assemblage, with all that this entails. </p>
            <p>We wish to thank the Faculty of Architecture and the Built Environment at TU Delft for inviting us this semester, and for setting up this symposium, with the help of Het Nieuwe Instituut and the Jaap Bakema Study Centre, in particular Dirk van den Heuvel and Victor Munoz Sanz for hosting and co-organising, as well as Jacques Vink, who will assist us at teaching the studio.</p>

Anyone can generate this booklet and the poster directly from the website, using the print button.</p>

                <p>The topic of <span class="no-poster no-print-booklet">this conference</span> <span class="no-screen">the <span class="poster-less-letter-spacing"><b>2017 International Symposium of the Faculty of Architecture and the Built Environment — TU Delft, with visiting professors ROTOR,</b> </span></span> is off-site reuse <span class="poster-only"><br></span>in architecture, a practice that involves salvaging components and materials from buildings that have reached the end of their life cycle, in order to reuse <span class="poster-only"><br></span>them elsewhere. Off-site reuse has been a common practice for centuries; however, during the twentieth century it became a forgotten art as most buildings <span class="poster-only"><br></span><span class="poster-less-letter-spacing">were built with no idea about reuse and the concomitant</span> question of sustainability. Today, the idea of off-site <span class="poster-only"><br></span>reuse is once again gaining momentum as the linear modes of materials consumption proper to the <span class="poster-only"><br></span>age of industrialization are being questioned.</p>
                <p>Yet, in a highly streamlined building industry, many <span class="poster-less-letter-spacing">obstacles and tenacious routines need to be overcome</span> <span class="poster-only"><br></span>to make these practices more than marginal again. <span class="poster-less-letter-spacing">Legislations need to be rewritten, certification protocols</span> <span class="poster-only"><br></span>to be reinvented; designers need to change habits, engineers to rethink component assembly technologies, etc. In the past decades, deconstruction professionals, designers and other experts have pushed this agenda <span class="poster-only"><br></span>and made some valuable progress. This symposium will bring several of these actors together in order to gauge where we stand now, what lies ahead and what <span class="poster-only"><br></span>progress is within reach, in terms of engineering, <span class="poster-only"><br></span>design and overall policy.</p>
                <p>The breached topics will fall under the following headings: </p>
                <p class="theme-questions">— What might off-site reuse mean in terms <span class="poster-only"><br></span>of building culture, heritage and social value?<br>
                — How to deconstruct existing buildings <span class="poster-only"><br></span>slated for demolition practically? What are <span class="poster-only"><br></span>the technological, logistical and adminis<span class="poster-only">-<br></span>trative implications?<br>
                — What design challenges, but also opportunities lie in the integration of existing components in new structures?<br>
                — How to design buildings in such a way <span class="poster-only"><br></span>that you maximize its potential for later reuse, on site, but also off-site? Is the “legolization” <span class="poster-only"><br></span>of the building industry within reach? And <span class="poster-only"><br></span>is it desirable?</p>
